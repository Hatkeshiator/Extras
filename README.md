# Extras

Any projects I feel like spending my spare time on.
Don't expect frequent updates, and expect mostly new programs to be added rather than existing ones updated for now.
Remind me not to skip lunch.

## Structure

- ./C contains the code for C side projects. These are all old and not that good. I might brush up on C someday not far from now.
- ./py contains the code for Python side projects. I will be using Python a lot more (bioinformatics) so this might be more active.
